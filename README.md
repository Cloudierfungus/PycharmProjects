# This is going to be a free and open source app for the coaches of scholastic bowl to keep track of their teams stats
# See TOADD.md in the KivyApp directory for a list of features I wish to add, and if you have any ideas then go ahead and share!
# This is an ideal project for beginners as I am a beginner myself. I love the open source community and would love for your contribution!
